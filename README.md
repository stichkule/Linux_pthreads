# Linux_pthreads
Basic pthread functionality in Linux
------------------------------------
Code for demonstrating and implementing basic threading applications using Linux and POSIX-compliant pthreads. A multi-threaded application for simulating a LCM-invariant schedule is also implemented. Timing analysis is also performed to evaluate jitter in timestamps provided by the native Linux kernel.
